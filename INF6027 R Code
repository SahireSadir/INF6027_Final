#FIRST STEP: DATA IMPORTING & DATA CLEANING

#improt my raw dataset(Excel file) from my desktop into the 'asli_filtersiz_putundata' variable in R

#SECOND STEP: EDA & VISUALIZING FOR QUESTION 1 (FIRST AIM OF STUDY)

#THIRD STEP: EDA & VISUALIZING FOR QUESTION 2 (SECOND AIM OF STUDY)

#FORTH STEP: EDA & VISUALIZING FOR QUESTION 3 (THIRD AIM OF STUDY)
#Question 3 (THIRD AIM)
#I generated the new dataset labled 'qestion3_uqinji_sual3' for Question 3 for my aim of this research (only storing 2 columns)

colSums(is.na(question3_uqinji_sual3))                      #Verify whether missing data still occur

#I calculated the correlation coefficient between `N diagnosed` (Amount of Diagnosed) and `% Endoscopic treatment` (Ratio of adopting endoscopic treatment)
